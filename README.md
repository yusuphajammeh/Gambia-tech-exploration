# 🚀 Y-J PORTFOLIO ARCHIVE
### Developer: YUSUPHA JAMMEH | Verified GitHub Student

Welcome to my automated development archive. This repository isn't just a collection of code—it’s a living system that tracks my progress, syncs my GitHub stats, and maintains a professional log of my journey in real-time.

## 🛠️ The 3-File Architecture
This project has been optimized into a consolidated 2026-standard system:

1.  **`YJ_Engine.py` (The Brain):** A centralized formatting engine that generates professional ASCII-boxed logs with precise timestamps.
2.  **`github_sync.py` (The Robot):** An automated worker that fetches GitHub API data, updates profile stats, and pings my website's `data.json` every hour.
3.  **`log.py` (The Mouth):** My personal command-line interface for manual milestone recording.

## 📊 Automated Features
* **Real-time Heartbeat:** Monitors system uptime via `heartbeat.txt`.
* **Dynamic Stats:** Tracks repository counts and account age (e.g., "1 Year Ago").
* **Executive Logging:** Maintains an `AI--Log.txt` archive in a high-fidelity terminal style.

## 🛡️ Verified Status
As a **Verified GitHub Student**, this system is part of my commitment to building transparent, automated, and professional-grade software.
